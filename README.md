Action: Test the enhanced food health tracking application backend with Indian food product support. Please test the following enhanced features:

1. **Indian OpenFoodFacts Integration**: Test the enhanced search functionality with Indian food terms like "basmati rice", "wheat atta", "toor dal", "amul milk", "britannia biscuit", "haldiram namkeen"
2. **Indian Food Categories API**: Test the /api/food/categories endpoint to verify it returns Indian food categories
3. **Indian Brand Prioritization**: Test if Indian brands (Amul, Britannia, Parle, Haldiram, MDH, Everest) are prioritized in search results
4. **Popular Indian Foods API**: Test the /api/food/popular-indian endpoint
5. **Enhanced Barcode Lookup**: Test with Indian product barcodes if available
6. **Indian Nutritional Guidelines**: Verify that health scoring works appropriately for Indian food products

Please focus on:
- Testing with actual Indian food product names
- Verifying the Indian database priority is working
- Checking that Indian brands appear first in search results
- Testing the new API endpoints
- Ensuring the enhanced health scoring works for Indian dietary patterns

The application now has comprehensive Indian food support with database prioritization, enhanced search terms, and adjusted nutritional guidelines.
